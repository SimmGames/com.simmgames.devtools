# DevTools
A Console and a Version Updated (Based on GitHub Commits)

If you add this to your project, these are some of the requirements for the versioning.
* Have git as a console app on your computer
* Have a tag on github. (Eg, "v1.2")

There is also a console and logs that come with this. The console will create files in the persistant directory for logs. There is no setup for the console needed.

To use the console, just use `Console.Log` instead of `Debug.Log`.

You will need to use the console class at least once to log anything run through the Debug class.
